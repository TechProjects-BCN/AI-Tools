# AI-Tutorials
Knowledge base for developing AI-related projects. Here you can find any relevant documentation and code to apply to your project.
If it's the first time you are coding in python. Please check: 

# Contents
0. **[AIBasics](https://github.com/TechProjects-BCN/AI-Tutorials/blob/main/0.AIBasics.ipynb)**. Where we introduce the concept of AI and simpler but very powerful algorithms and concepts (e.g. Pathfinding, Sentiment Analysis, Probability of events,...)
1. **[Models](https://github.com/TechProjects-BCN/AI-Tutorials/blob/main/1.Models.ipynb)**. Basics on Models and Pytorch. Also useful for any simple project or basic prototype.
2. **[Regression](https://github.com/TechProjects-BCN/AI-Tutorials/blob/main/2.Regression.ipynb)**. Useful for any project where we are trying to predict data. (e.g. Temperature rise from indicators, Weather, ...)
3. **Classification**. For any project where we are trying to get the probability of something belonging to a specific. (e.g. Probability of diabetes, Classifying images,...)
